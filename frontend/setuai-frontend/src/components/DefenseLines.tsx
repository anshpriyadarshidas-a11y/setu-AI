/**
 * DefenseLines — a field of thin vertical filaments rising through the frame,
 * lit by a soft vertical band that runs down the middle.
 *
 * There is no light source and no blur. Every filament reads its own distance
 * from a FOCUS POINT and uses that one number four ways at once: it grows up to
 * five times longer, it brightens, its red washes out toward white, and it
 * speeds up. Nothing else changes across the frame. That single coupling is why
 * the centre band reads as a beam of attention rather than as a gradient laid
 * over the top -- the filaments are not being lit, they are behaving differently
 * where the focus is.
 *
 * The falloff is deliberately lopsided: horizontal distance can take a filament
 * to zero on its own, while vertical distance only ever scales it between 0.4
 * and 1.0. That is what makes the bright region a vertical BAND spanning the
 * full height rather than a round hotspot, and it is the difference between this
 * and a radial gradient.
 *
 * Each filament is drawn as two quads, not one, because its gradient has three
 * stops -- transparent, lit, transparent. One quad can only interpolate between
 * its two ends and would fade the whole length in a single direction. The split
 * at the midpoint is what puts the light in the middle of the line.
 *
 * What the port changed, and why:
 *
 *  - The source is Canvas 2D and calls createLinearGradient() once PER LINE PER
 *    FRAME -- a hundred gradient objects a frame, allocated and thrown away.
 *    This is one WebGL draw call: the ramp is a vertex attribute and the colour
 *    is resolved in the fragment shader, so nothing is allocated in the loop.
 *  - Positions advanced by a fixed step PER FRAME, so the field rose at whatever
 *    rate the display refreshed. Per-second off a measured dt now, and Speed
 *    reads 50 for the shipped rate.
 *  - The canvas sized itself from window.innerWidth/innerHeight, which in Framer
 *    is the browser window rather than the component. Sized from the injected
 *    width/height.
 *  - A line width below one device pixel cannot be rasterized: it either
 *    disappears or snaps to a full pixel and reads twice as heavy. The quad is
 *    widened to one device pixel and its alpha scaled by how much it was
 *    widened, which is what Canvas 2D's antialiasing was doing implicitly for
 *    the source's 0.5px stroke.
 *  - The particle count halved below 768px. A component that resizes itself by
 *    viewport width fights whatever the designer set, so it is one Density dial.
 *  - The light/dark MODE enum only ever swapped two hard-coded reds. The colour
 *    dials already do that, so it is gone rather than duplicated.
 *  - Respawn used Math.random(), so no two renders of the same settings matched.
 *    Seeded, which is also what makes the dial checks in the probe meaningful.
 *
 * The canvas carried a fixed 50% opacity in the page it came from; that is the
 * Lines > Opacity default rather than a hidden constant. The blurred red glow
 * behind it belonged to the hero section, not to this effect, and is not here.
 *
 * Ported from ThreeUI's Defense Lines (Constellation Field / Neuform).
 * INTERACTION HAS BEEN REMOVED: the focus point is pinned to the frame's
 * centre, exactly as the source shipped, with no pointer tracking.
 *
 * DIRECTION IS ALSO AN ADDITION -- the source only ever rose. It rotates the
 * FIELD, not the lines: travel, the wrap edges and the focus falloff are all
 * computed in the field's own two axes, so the lit band keeps running with the
 * filaments instead of staying stuck vertical while they turn. Positions are
 * stored normalized to those axes, which is what lets the angle change without
 * re-seeding. 0 is up, exactly as shipped.
